Mesic is made by Dư Thanh Huy (front end, backend) and Lê Vĩ Nguyên (back end, file structure and code structure)
However, due to circumstances during development, the project's original repo belongs to LVNguyenn
This is a reupload onto my repo for archiving purposes and to ascertain that I am the co-owner of Mesic's source files, along side Lê Vĩ Nguyên
